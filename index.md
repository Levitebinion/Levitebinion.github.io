## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 12, part-2

  was a favorite lab because it helped with my understanding of nested loops and also randomized numbers at the same time. at first I was confused as to how each pixel could be randomized and it seemed a it intimidating but after going to tutoring and discussing how the outer loop was doing rows and the inner was doing columns and then assigning random RGB values to each it made much better sense to me. finally we were able to create a .gif in this lab with elements I mentioned and overall the most satisfying part was seeing the picture be created after running the program in the terminal.
  
* Lab 7, part-2 
  was another favorite because I already enjoy playing blackjack as it is, so it was easy to just get straight to the code since I already knew the rules. Initially I didn't understand how to get around the issue of making Aces sometimes worth 1 or 11 but when I did figure out that application of if statements it set the ground work for future labs. obviously this lab we couldn't actually play blackjack but it was definitely a great way for anyone new to it to understand the scoring system of the game.

* Lab 11, part-1
    this lab was the really the first one we applied our knowledge from lecture on classes. this one got the gears turning in my head because with classes we can essentially make our own variables in our code to represent specific things. seeing this simplified coding a lot for me because up until this lab it felt as if I couldn't be as specific as I wanted to be in naming variables in labs. another element of this lab was inputtiing and outputting information in files from the terminal. This lab felt like a real world, and useful application of code.
