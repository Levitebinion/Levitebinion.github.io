I am a computer science major at CSUF and  plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt.,
